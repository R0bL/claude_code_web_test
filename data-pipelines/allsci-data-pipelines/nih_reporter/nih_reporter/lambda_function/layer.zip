# Placeholder for Lambda layer.zip
# 
# This file should be a real zip archive containing the python dependencies.
# Build it using the instructions in BUILD_LAYER.md
#
# The layer will be created during deployment and should include:
# - requests library and its dependencies
#
# Note: This placeholder exists so the CDK construct can reference it.
# Replace with actual layer.zip before deploying.
